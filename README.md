### üöó Mobility üöó

#### Chassis
We use the `Carisma GT24`, a pre-built 1/24 scale RC car (15 cm in length), as opposed to the 1/18 scale car (26.5 cm in length) from the previous year. This is to accomodate the addition of the magenta parking lot in the obstacle challenge, and it allows us to simply park head-on, which is a more efficient procedure compared to parallel parking. 

#### Motors
Our car uses a `Furitek Micro Komodo Brushless Motor`. Brushless motors refer to the lack of small "brushes" in the motor that a brushed motor would have. The design reduces friction within the motor, and provides a longer lifespan, greater torque, efficiency, and acceleration. 

The Furitek Micro Komodo specifically is also very small compared to other RC car motors on the market, making it fit well with our small chassis.

To control steering, we have use a `Hitec HS-5055MG Servo Motor`, which is a metal gear servo motor. The servo motor that originally came with the RC chassis had a weaker plastic gear and a five-wire connection. We replaced it with a new servo that has a three-wire connection, which we can control and power with the `Raspberry Pi Hardware Attached on Top` (HAT). 

To send signals to both these components, we use a `Furitek Lizard Pro Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)`, which came with the brushless motor.

### üëÄ Camera Vision üëÄ
We use a `SainSmart Wide-Angle Camera`, which carries pixel data to the HAT via a Camera Serial Interface (CSI) cable. Based on said pixel data, we can determine the size (and distance) of surrounding objects, such as the red and green obstacles, the blue and orange lines on the game mat, and the black walls.

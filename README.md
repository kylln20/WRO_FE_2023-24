### 🚗 Mobility 🚗

#### Chassis
We use the `Carisma GT24`, a pre-built 1/24 scale RC car (15 cm in length), as opposed to the 1/18 scale car (26.5 cm in length) from the previous year. This is to accomodate the addition of the magenta parking lot in the obstacle challenge, and it allows us to simply park head-on, which is a more efficient procedure compared to parallel parking. 

#### Motors
Our car uses a `Furitek Micro Komodo Brushless Motor`. Brushless motors refer to the lack of small "brushes" in the motor that a brushed motor would have. The design reduces friction within the motor, and provides a longer lifespan, greater torque, efficiency, and acceleration. 

The Furitek Micro Komodo specifically is also very small compared to other RC car motors on the market, making it fit well with our small chassis.

To control steering, we have use a `Hitec HS-5055MG Servo Motor`, which is a metal gear servo motor. The servo motor that originally came with the RC chassis had a weaker plastic gear and a five-wire connection. We replaced it with a new servo that has a three-wire connection, which we can control and power with the `Raspberry Pi Hardware Attached on Top` (HAT). 

To send signals to both these components, we use a `Furitek Lizard Pro Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)`, which came with the brushless motor.

&nbsp;

### 👀 Camera Vision 👀
We use a `SainSmart Wide-Angle Camera`, which carries pixel data to the HAT via a Camera Serial Interface (CSI) cable. Based on said pixel data, we can determine the size (and distance) of surrounding objects, such as the red and green obstacles, the blue and orange lines on the game mat, and the black walls.

## 💻 Software 💻

We use a Raspberry Pi 4 Board as our single board computer (SBC). It is connected to the HAT, from which it takes and processes sensor input to return turning-angle and speed values back to the HAT, which then get sent to the servo and DC motors respectively. 

The program running on the Raspberry Pi is written in Python.     
&nbsp;

* ### Libraries in use:
  * `OpenCV` (for computer vision)
  * `picamera2` (for camera control)
  * `HiwonderSDK.Board` (for HAT communication)
  * `RPi.GPIO` (for GPIO control on the Raspberry Pi)
  * `Time` (for time-related functions, mainly: sleep())
  * `numpy` (for numerical operation and array processing)

### Object Detection
The camera captures an image which is converted from OpenCV’s default pixel data format of BGR (blue, green, red) to HSV (hue, saturation, value). Then, binary thresholding is applied, which changes the pixel data of the processed image such that areas of interest are white, and everything else is black. The bounded white areas can then be extracted as a list of contours within a specified region of interest. 
Areas of interest are defined based on a colour mask (a range of HSV values). Such allows us to account for slight differences in lighting which would cause colour variation. Depending on the colour mask and the region of interest, we can, from the generated list of contours, measure the size of (and effectively, the distance from and position of) obstacles, coloured lines, and the walls themself. 

&nbsp;

#### Signal Pillar and Parking Wall Detection
Signal pillars are found with green and/or red colour masks, and by searching in a region of interest specific to the locations of the obstacles. The parking walls are found with magenta colour masks and by searching in a region of interest near the walls.

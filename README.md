### üöó Mobility üöó

#### Chassis
We use the chassis of the `Carisma GT24`, a pre-built 1/24 scale RC car (15 cm in length), as opposed to the 1/18 scale car (26.5 cm in length) from the previous year. This is to accommodate the addition of the magenta parking lot in the obstacle challenge, and it allows us to simply park head-on, which is a more efficient procedure compared to parallel parking. 

#### Design 
Our car consists of the chassis of the `Carisma GT24` with 3D-printed components placed on top to hold extra electronic components

<img src="https://github.com/kylln20/WRO_FE_2023-24/blob/main/other/extra%20images/Labeled.jpg" width="40%" height="40%"> <img src="https://github.com/kylln20/WRO_FE_2023-24/blob/main/other/extra%20images/Labeled2.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">

1. **Base Nut Front / Back**: used to secure the 3D-printed base onto the chassis
2. **Cable Barrier**: is attached to the chassis to prevent cables from interfering with tires
3. **Camera Extension**: a piece attaching to the car‚Äôs base to give the camera extra height and tilt
4. **Camera Mount**: the piece the camera is attached to, adds height and tilt
5. **Camera Support**: used to help stabilize the overall camera structure
6. **Car Base**: the main platform of the car, is attached to the chassis through 4 posts, components of the base includes:
    - Holder for Raspberry Pi
    - Holder for cooling fan 
    - Holder for battery
    - Vertical post to route battery cable
    - Cable ladder organizer on the right side
    - Hook on the left to hold the power cable in place
7. **Servo Attachment**: attaches to the servo motor and controls steering

#### Motors
Our car uses a `Furitek Micro Komodo Brushless Motor`. Brushless motors refer to the lack of small "brushes" in the motor that a brushed motor would have. This design reduces motor friction, improving lifespan, torque, efficiency, and acceleration.

The `Furitek Micro Komodo` is also very small compared to other RC car motors, making it fit well with our small chassis. The motor is mounted on a sturdy `aluminum mount` instead of the standard plastic mount, increasing durability and passive cooling. 

To control steering, we use a `Hitec HS-5055MG Servo Motor`, which is a metal gear servo motor. The servo motor that originally came with the RC chassis had a weaker plastic gear and a five-wire connection. We replaced it with a new servo with a three-wire connection (signal, voltage, ground), which we can control and power directly from a motor port on the `Raspberry Pi Hardware Attached on Top (HAT)`. It is connected to the wheel axis with a 3D-printed adapter piece that is screwed onto the rotational part of the servo. However, it is to be noted that the 3D printed piece is not perfectly secured to the axis and will, on the rare occasion, pop out.

The `Furitek Micro Komodo Brushless Motor` receives power and signal from the `Furitek Lizard Pro Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)`, which comes with the brushless motor. Similarly to the servo, the signals used are PWM (pulse-width modulation) signals from the Pi HAT's motor ports. 
&nbsp;

### üëÄ Camera Vision üëÄ
We use a `SainSmart Wide-Angle Camera`, which carries pixel data to the HAT via a Camera Serial Interface (CSI) cable. Based on said pixel data, we can identify those objects based on their size and colour. From such information, our program will calculate the desired speed and turning angle which it will send through the HAT to the DC and servo motors respectively with pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. 
&nbsp;

### ‚ö° Electricity & Power ‚ö°
Our car gets power from a single `Gens Ace 1300mAh Battery` which powers the Raspberry Pi and ESC circuit. This battery was chosen mainly due to its high 45 C rating allowing for a higher discharge of electricity while still being lightweight and compact. 

Although the Raspberry Pi 4B runs off 5V, our Pi HAT contains a voltage regulator allowing the 7.4V output of the battery to be limited to 5V to power the Raspberry Pi. 

The wires of the battery are connected to the circuits of the Raspberry Pi and ESC in parallel with a switch controlling the passage of electricity at the beginning of the circuit. This design eliminated the need for two separate batteries, saving space, simplifying our circuit, and reducing the car‚Äôs overall weight.

The battery wires, Raspberry Pi, ESC, and switch are all soldered together, making the wiring very durable. 

The wiring is placed underneath the car base. The switch is secured near the back of the car with a zip tie, the battery cable comes out of the right, the Raspberry Pi Power Adapter comes out from the left, and the ESC is placed in the center.

## üíª Software üíª
We use a Raspberry Pi 4 Board as our single board computer (SBC). It is connected to the HAT, from which it takes and processes sensor input to return turning-angle and speed values back to the HAT, which then get sent to the servo and DC motors respectively. 

The program running on the Raspberry Pi is written in Python.     
&nbsp;

### Initialization and Connection Process
We used the Raspberry Pi imager to write a custom Raspberry Pi operating system onto an SD card that allowed us to use our Pi hat. Once the operating system is downloaded onto the SD card, when the Raspberry Pi is running AP (Access Point) mode, we can connect to the Raspberry Pi through a wifi connection. Once we have selected the Access Point in the wifi tab, we use VNC Viewer to connect remotely to and interact with the Raspberry Pi using a set IP address. 

&nbsp;

### Object Detection
The camera captures an image which the program then converts from OpenCV‚Äôs default pixel data format of BGR (blue, green, red) to HSV (hue, saturation, value). Then, binary thresholding is applied, which changes the pixel data of the inputted image such that areas of interest are white, and everything else is black. This is done with the OpenCV library inRange() function, where we specify the input image and a colour mask (a range of HSV values). The input image can be modified with array splicing so we only search in a specific region of interest. The colour mask[^2] allows us to account for how lighting causes colour variation for the target object.

The bounded white areas can then be extracted as a list of contours within a specified region of interest. By measuring the size of each contour by using the OpenCV library function contourArea(), we can predict which contour(s) is the target object by checking if the contour is within a certain size range. The target objects may be the signal pillars, the coloured lines on the game mat, the magenta parking lot, or even the black walls around the track.

[^2]: The colour masks used for each object still depend on the environment the car is in. We had difficulties getting the program to perform well in a room with yellow-tinted lights instead of white LEDs. This required changing the colour masks when running the car in that environment. An existing code that was useful for finding/adjusting colour masks was from an [OpenCV tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d97/tutorial_threshold_inRange.html), which was modified to be the ColourTester.py code.

&nbsp;

#### Wall Detection/Management
The wall contours are detected with the colour mask ([0, 0, 0] to [180, 255, 50]), and two regions of interest‚Äîone for the left wall, and one for the right wall. To stay centred when driving straight, we use a PD algorithm. P stands for proportional, and D stands for derivative. The algorithm involves calculating the difference between the areas of the two contours and calculating a turning angle based on:

* A difference in contour areas (error)
* A straight constant (straightConst)- the number that would be sent for the car to go straight
* A proportional constant (cKp) - the constant that gets multiplied by error 
* A derivative constant (cKd) - the constant that gets multiplied by the difference in the error and the previous error (prevError)

The resulting calculation is:
> angle = int(straightConst + error * cKp + (error - prevError) * cKd)

PID is the standard algorithm (with a demonstration in this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKy98Cbcltw)). ‚ÄúI‚Äù stands for integral, which represents a different constant that would be multiplied against an average error. However, while testing the cKp and cKd, we found our program was consistent enough without the added calculations, or the arduous trial and error that would be required to find a cKi value
&nbsp;

#### Open Challenge Corner Detection
The program detects when the car is approaching a corner when the area of one wall contour is significantly less than the area of the other wall contour. This is because, once the car has approached a corner, the wall on the side it needs to turn to is barely visible. Once it has reached the threshold, it starts turning until the difference between contour areas has decreased enough. Then the car returns to the PD algorithm.

Additionally, to count the number of corners the car has passed, the program counts the orange lines on the mat. The line is searched for using binary thresholding, with an orange colour mask on a centred region of interest. Once the area of the line contour has passed a certain value, the program knows the car has passed a corner.
&nbsp;

#### Obstacle Challenge Corner Detection
Unlike the open challenge, in the obstacle challenge, it is not optimal for the car to be centred while turning as there may be a signal pillar to avoid immediately after the turn. To compensate, the obstacle challenge code instead enters a turning mode once the nearest mat line (blue if travelling clockwise, orange if travelling counter-clockwise) has been detected and is of a certain area. 

The degree to which the car must turn depends on whether it detects a signal pillar after the turn while it approaches the turn. If it does detect a signal pillar, the program switches from turning mode to going straight mode. Otherwise, like in the open challenge, the program will stop turning when the difference between the two wall contours has decreased to a certain threshold.
&nbsp;

#### Signal Pillar Detection/Management
Signal pillars are found with green and red colour masks, and by searching in a region of interest specific to the locations of the obstacles. 

A function called boundingRect() approximates a rectangle around the selected contour. boundingRect() also returns the x and y coordinates of the rectangle‚Äôs top left corner. When applied to the contour of the signal pillar, this can be used to determine its location.

We avoid the signal pillars by using a PD (Proportional and Derivative) calculation based on the difference between the x-coordinate of the signal pillar, and the target x-coordinate. The target x-coordinate for the green pillars is near the right side, as the car needs to pass it on the left side. The opposite is true for the red pillars. The calculation also includes a value changing the angle based on how close the pillar is by using the pillar's y-value. 

Additionally, we change the control variables to be weaker when 2 or more pillars of the same color are seen, this is done so the car can successfully navigate tight corner cases. 

While we detect a pillar, if the area of the left or right walls becomes too large, we deselect the current pillar so the wall areas determine the angle instead. This allows the car to turn towards the middle and avoid hitting the wall

After twelve turns, once the car has completed three laps and is searching for the parking lot, the target x-coordinate is such that the car drives toward the outside of the red and green pillars.
&nbsp;

#### Parking Lot Detection/Management
The parking walls are found with magenta colour masks and by searching in three regions of interest that when combined cover the vertical middle of the captured image, again with binary thresholding. This starts after twelve turns. If it is the case that after thirteen turns, the magenta parking lot isn‚Äôt detected, then parking mode will start after a magenta contour of the right size reaches a specific Y-coordinate.

Once the magenta parking lot has been found in the left or right region of interest, the car turns in that direction. If the program detects a magenta contour in the central region of interest, it backs up, to allow more distance to adjust and park between the walls without touching them. Additionally, while parking into the lot on the left, if the right region of interest is found to have a large enough area in both magenta and black, the car is too far left meaning we have to turn right. 

The car stops once the area of the wall detected in the middle is large enough. 
&nbsp;

#### Three-Point Turn Detection/Management
After the eighth turn has been counted by seeing a wall or a pillar, we check whether a three-point turn is required. This is done when checking the colour and area of the current pillar along with the colour of the last passed pillar. 

Since each colour pillar would cause the angle of our approach to differ when reaching the corner, we have different cases for the following: 

* When the last pillar before the corner is red 
* When the last pillar before the corner is green 

If the pillar before the corner forces us to go wider into the corner, the contour area of the pillar right after the corner would be smaller because of the size of the region of interest. So if the next visible pillar is red, the program will run the three-point turn.

If the pillar before the corner forces us into a tighter turn, the contour areas of the pillars would be larger. The program must check whether the area is large enough to guarantee the pillar detected is the last pillar of the lap. If it is, and the pillar is also red, the program will run the three-point turn.

If there is no pillar right before the corner, our car will naturally take a tighter turn meaning the areas of the pillars would be larger. This means the last pillar doesn't matter as the area would exceed the thresholds for both cases. 

If the turn ended by seeing a wall instead of a pillar, if the last pillar seen was red then the car turns as the last pillar seen is the last pillar of the second lap. 
&nbsp;

##### Performing Three Point Turn
Once we know a three-point turn must be performed, the car will immediately turn to the left unless it detects a red pillar, in which case it will turn after passing the red pillar by waiting until no pillar is detected for 10 iterations of the main loop. The car will turn left until it detects the wall or parking lot in front. It will then back up while turning to the right for a certain period. Then the program will resume

After the initial three-point turn, if the car detects a large black area in front again, the initial three-point turn isn't sharp enough, so another three-point turn is performed.

If the car doesn't the wall in front and instead comes too close to a pillar instead, it means the car has already turned around, so we count an extra turn and change turn direction.

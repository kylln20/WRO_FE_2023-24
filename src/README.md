# Source Code
This directory contains all the code and other files used in the process of programming our vehicle. 

- ColourTesterLAB.py - a modified version of the ColourTester.py, used to find and adjust the colour masks used to detect different obstacles
- ObstacleChallengeV2.py - the code that we run for the obstacle challenge. This version was made after the Canada National WRO Competition
- OpenChallenge.py - the code that we run for the open challenge. This has been largely unchanged since the Canada National WRO Competition
- WRO_Randomizer.py - to ensure that we tested all possible cases, a randomiser was made with <>
- functions.py - to make our code easier to read and update, all self-defined functions that are used in both the ObstacleChallengeV2.py code and the OpenChallenge.py code were put in this file
- masks.py - a file to record the colour masks that we use in the code.
